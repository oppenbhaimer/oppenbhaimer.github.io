I once asked a friend a long time back on why he didn't write much nowadays.
His reason was that his posts had created a new standard that he had to live up
to. Whenever he wrote something new, he felt it didn't live up to that
standard, and trashed it in the bin.

> "That's absurd"<br>
> "Not Really. I went to \<insert convention\> and had so many people tell me my
article about \<famous movie\> was so amazing. I have to maintain this!"

What followed was also him deleting several personal articles on his blog.

I was disappointed at this. I felt that when we write, we write for ourselves.
We write to speak our minds, to communicate our ideas, no matter how rough,
orthogonal or multifaceted they may be, because that's who we are.

Nope.

I now find myself sinking into the same quicksand, unable to publish on my
original blog. Any post I make has to reflect my 'image'. People on the
admissions committee are looking. Externalities like this freeze you up. The
only alternative is an anon blog (which is what this is :P).
